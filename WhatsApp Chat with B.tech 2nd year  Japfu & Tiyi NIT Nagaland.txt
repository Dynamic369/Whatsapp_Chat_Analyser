17/11/2023, 14:32 - Nipun: To the person who stole our lights,

We are very upset and frustrated with your act of stealing our lights that we had purchased and decorated for the celebration of Diwali. Diwali is a festival of lights, happiness, and goodwill, and you have spoiled our enthusiasm and mood by taking away our source of illumination.

You may think that you have done a smart thing by stealing our lights, but you have actually done a foolish thing: you have lost your honesty, your dignity, and your kindness. You have also offended the sentiments of many people who had put in effort and money to make our hostel look bright and festive.

We demand you to return our lights as soon as possible and admit your error. We hope that you will understand your mistake and repent for it. We also hope that you will never do such a disgraceful and greedy act again.

We are not here to quarrel or create problems, but to live in harmony and peace. We want to celebrate Diwali with everyone, including you, and spread the joy and grace of this auspicious occasion. But we cannot do that if you keep our lights with you.

Please be a decent person and do the right thing. Return our lights and join us in the celebration of Diwali. We are waiting for your reply.

It is a hassle for the people as there is a water crisis in the hostel when you do not bring it back. 
Kindly be aware of yourself and bring it back after you have used it. Do not hoard the jars and cause problems to the people. If so do not blame the caretaker for the shortage of water as we are collectively responsible for the shortage.
